Hi and welcome to this blog!

Below you will find a list of blog posts: I will share my **learnings in the field of "Deep Learning"** on this blog. I hope you will find it interesting.
I`m going through the the fast.ai course currently, called: [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://www.fast.ai/).
Some blog posts may be examples or exercises from the course.
