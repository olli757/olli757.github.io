# About me

Hi! My name is Olivier Moens, I`m 37 years old from **Belgium**. I`m married and together we have a beautiful daughter of two years old.
Since 2002 I've been working in **aviation** as a pilot. I developed a passion for programming since 2017. I've long been passionate about everything gadgets and computers and I had a big interest in the world of **programming** computers. Finally I got started by following the **"CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science"** course from Harvard that you can follow along online. It's a fantastic course and since I have been hooked. I followed up with more self study and also completed two subjects (**Java** and **Computer Systems**) at the "Karel de Grote Hogeschool" in Antwerp, Belgium as part of their flexible learning trajectory. 

I`m still discovering the huge field of IT and I enjoy learning more and more about it.
My current project is in the field of AI: Deep Learning. I`m going through the fast.ai course called ["Deep Learning for Coders"](https://www.fast.ai/).
